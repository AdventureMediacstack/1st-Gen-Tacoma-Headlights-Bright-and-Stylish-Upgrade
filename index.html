                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>A Product Made for Tacoma Owners Who Care</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>The 1998–2000 Tacoma isn’t just a truck, it’s part of your lifestyle. Whether you use it for daily commuting, off-road adventures, or weekend projects, you need lighting that keeps up with the way you drive. Stock headlights often become dim or yellow over time, which not only affects the look of your truck but also your visibility at night.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Our</span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336252530_A_Retrofit_for_Controlling_the_Brightness_of_an_Automotive_Headlight_to_Reduce_Glare_by_using_Embedded_C_Program_on_a_PIC_Microcontroller"><span> retrofit headlights</span></a><span> are designed specifically for the first-generation Tacoma. That means no cutting corners or trying to make a “universal” product fit. You’ll get headlights that slot right in, giving you the performance you expect while preserving the classic appearance of your Tacoma.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Highlights That Make a Difference</span></h2>

                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Why Our Retrofit Headlights Are the Right Choice</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Driving with old headlights can feel like peering through a foggy window. Not only does it limit what you can see, but it also makes it harder for other drivers to see you. That’s where our retrofit headlights step in. They’re designed to:</span></p>
                <p role="presentation" dir="ltr"><span>● Improve safety with brighter, cleaner illumination.</span><span><br><br></span></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><span>Unlike cheap aftermarket lights, ours are crafted with durability and fitment in mind. We know Tacoma owners take pride in their trucks, which is why we created headlights that live up to that same standard.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What’s Included When You Order</span></h2>
